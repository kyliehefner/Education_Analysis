# Education_Analysis

## Scoping
Scoping a data analysis project is crucial because it establishes the framework for the project and helps ensure that the analysis is focused, relevant, and feasible.

### Project Goals
The goal of this data analysis project is to compare the United States' educational performance with that of other countries and identify potential areas for improvement. Specifically, the project aims to analyze internationally comparable educational indicators such as access, literacy, and cost across 268 countries. By comparing the United States' performance with that of other countries, we can gain insights into what factors contribute to successful educational systems and identify potential areas for improvement in the United States.

### Data Overview
The data used in this project is sourced from the World Bank EdStats Open Data, which includes over 4,000 indicators spanning from 1970 to 2014. The dataset contains data from world learning assessments such as the TIMSS study, providing a comprehensive view of educational performance across multiple countries. The data will be preprocessed to remove missing or irrelevant data and ensure that it is in a suitable format for analysis.

### Analysis Strategy
The analysis for this project will involve exploratory analysis and visualization to identify patterns and relationships within the data. I will examine how the United States compares with other countries in terms of educational access, literacy, and cost, and identify factors that contribute to successful educational systems. Additionally, I will evaluate whether another method of analysis, such as regression analysis or clustering, is needed to gain further insights into the data. Ultimately, this project aims to provide actionable insights that can inform policy and decision-making aimed at improving the United States' educational system.
